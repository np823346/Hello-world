Hi, I'm Sam, an aspiring web developer.
recently, I was elected to become the technology chair of my orgnanization, so I plan to use GitHub to begin develpoing the new framework for my website! I've been studying HTML and CSS on codeacademy, and next plan to look at Javascript to further my understanding of webpages.
